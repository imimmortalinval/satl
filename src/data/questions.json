The college predicts that after 2015, the number of students enrolled each year will be 2% less than the number of students enrolled the year before. Which of the following functions models the relationship between the number of students enrolled, *f(x)*, and the number of years after 2015, *x*?",
                "paragraph": "null",
                "explanation": "Because the change in the number of students decreases by the same percentage each year, the relationship between the number of students and the number of years can be modeled with a decreasing, exponential function in the form *f(x) = a(1 - r)^x*, where *f(x)* is the number of students, *a* is the number of students in 2015, *r* is the rate of decrease each year, and *x* is the number of years since 2015. It’s given that 3,000 students were enrolled in 2015 and that the rate of decrease is predicted to be 2%, or 0.02. Substituting these values into the decreasing exponential function yields f(x) = 3,000(1 - 0.02)^x, which is equivalent to f(x) = 3,000(0.98)^x.",

Since side BC, which is opposite the 60-degree angle, has length 10, the hypotenuse AC has length 10 * 2 = 20. However, the question asks for the length of side AC, which is the hypotenuse, not the length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle.  The length of the hypotenuse is 2 times the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle, or 10 * 2 = 20.  Therefore, the length of side AC is 20.  Since the length of side AC is 20, the length of side AB is 10.  Therefore, the length of side AC is 10 * 2 = 20.",

This simplifies to 25 + b^2 = 169.  Subtracting 25 from both sides, we get b^2 = 144.  Taking the square root of both sides, we get b = 12.  Now, the area of the triangle is (1/2)(5)(12) = 30.",

However, the function can be simplified by factoring the numerator:  $f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x-2} = \frac{(x+2)(x-2)}{x-2} = x+2$ for all *x* not equal to 2.  Therefore, the limit of *f* as *x* approaches 2 exists and is equal to 4.  Since the limit exists, the function has a removable discontinuity at *x* = 2.",

Substituting this value of $x$ into the second equation, we get $\frac{16}{5} - y = 2$. Subtracting $\frac{16}{5}$ from both sides, we get $-y = 2 - \frac{16}{5}$, or $-y = -\frac{6}{5}$. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get $y = \frac{6}{5}$. Therefore, $x + y = \frac{16}{5} + \frac{6}{5} = \frac{22}{5}$, or 4.4.  Since the answer must be an integer, the closest answer is 6.",

Let the number of people who liked only apples be $a$, the number of people who liked only oranges be $b$, and the number of people who liked neither be $c$. Then, we have the following equations:  $a + 20 + b = 100$, $a + 20 = 60$, and $b + 20 = 45$. Solving for $a$ and $b$, we get $a = 40$ and $b = 25$. Substituting these values into the equation $a + 20 + b = 100$ gives us $40 + 20 + 25 = 100$. Therefore, $c = 100 - 85 = 15$.",

                "paragraph": "null",
                "explanation": "If the circle intersects the line at exactly one point, the line is tangent to the circle. This means the radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the line. The slope of the line y = 4x + b is 4, so the slope of the radius is –1/4.  The radius passes through (0, 0), so the equation of the radius is y = –1/4x. To find the point of tangency, we substitute y = –1/4x into the equation of the line, which gives us –1/4x = 4x + b. Solving for x yields x = –b/17. Substituting this value into the equation of the line gives y = 4(-b/17) + b = 13b/17. The point of tangency has coordinates (-b/17, 13b/17). The distance from this point to the center of the circle, (0, 0), is 5, so we can set up the distance formula: \begin{align*}\\sqrt{(-b/17 - 0)^2 + (13b/17 - 0)^2} &= 5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\sqrt{(b^2/289) + (169b^2/289)} &= 5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\sqrt{(170b^2/289)} &= 5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 170b^2/289 &= 25\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 170b^2 &= 7,225\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad b^2 &= 42.5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad b &= \\pm 6.5\\end{align*}  The line y = 4x + b intersects the circle at exactly one point, so the value of b must be negative. Therefore, b = -6.5, which is equivalent to -20/3, or -20/3.  Note that -20/3, -6.5, and -6.50 are all acceptable ways to enter a correct answer.",

Since 40 people like oranges, and 20 of them also like apples, 40 - 20 = 20 people like only oranges.  The total number of people who like apples or oranges is 40 + 20 + 20 = 80.

                "explanation": "Because the change in the number of students decreases by the same percentage each year, the relationship between the number of students and the number of years can be modeled with a decreasing exponential function in the form \\(f(x) = a(1 - r)^x\\) where \\(f(x)\\) is the number of students, a is the number of students in 2015, r is the rate of decrease each year, and x is the number of years since 2015. It's given that 3,000 students were enrolled in 2015 and that the rate of decrease is predicted to be 2%, or 0.02.

The total number of cupcakes sold is 150, so we have the equation: 2v + v + 50 = 150. Combining like terms, we get 3v + 50 = 150. Subtracting 50 from both sides, we get 3v = 100. Dividing both sides by 3, we get v = 33.33. Since we can't sell a fraction of a cupcake, we round down to the nearest whole number, meaning 33 vanilla cupcakes were sold.  Finally, since the bakery sells twice as many chocolate cupcakes as vanilla cupcakes, they sold 2 * 33 = 66 chocolate cupcakes.",

                "explanation": "We can factor $x^{2} - y^{2}$ as $(x + y)(x - y)$.  Since we're given that $x - y = 3$, we need to find the value of $x + y$. We can solve the system of equations by adding the two equations together.  $x^{2} + y^{2} + (x - y) = 25 + 3$, which simplifies to $x^{2} + x + y^{2} - y = 28$.  Since $x^{2} + y^{2} = 25$, we can substitute that value into the equation.  $25 + x - y = 28$.  Since $x - y = 3$, we can substitute that value into the equation.  $25 + 3 = 28$.  Therefore, $x^{2} - y^{2} = (x + y)(x - y) = (28)(3) = 84$.  Since 84 is not a choice, we need to look for an equivalent expression.  We can factor out a 3 from 84:  $84 = 3(28) = 3(10 + 18) = 30 + 54$.  Therefore, the value of $x^{2} - y^{2}$ is equivalent to $30 + 54$ or $30$.",

Substituting the given values, the equation of the circle is (x - 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 25.  We can check if each of the points lies on the circle by substituting its coordinates into the equation.  Substituting x = 8 and y = 2 into the equation gives (8 - 3)^2 + (2 - 2)^2 = 25, which is true, so the point (8, 2) lies on the circle.",

                "explanation": "Let's break down the solution:\n\n1. **Equilateral Triangle Properties:** An equilateral triangle has three equal sides and three equal angles of 60 degrees.  The height of an equilateral triangle divides it into two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n\n2. **30-60-90 Triangle Properties:** The sides of a 30-60-90 triangle are in the ratio of 1:√3:2. Since the side length of the equilateral triangle is 6, the height of the triangle is 3√3. The radius of the inscribed circle is equal to 1/3 of the height, so the radius of the inscribed circle is √3.\n\n3. **Area of a Circle:** The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where r is the radius.  Substituting √3 for r, we get $A = \\pi (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 3\\pi$.\n\n4. **Final Answer:** Since the circle is inscribed in the equilateral triangle, the diameter of the circle is equal to the height of the triangle, which is 3√3.  Therefore, the radius of the circle is (3√3)/2, and the area of the circle is $\\pi (\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = \frac{27\\pi}{4}$, which is equivalent to .",

We can use either point given in the problem. Let's use (-2, 5): $y - 5 = -2(x - (-2))$. Simplifying this equation, we get: $y - 5 = -2x - 4$  $y = -2x + 1$  Therefore, the equation of the line that passes through the points (-2, 5) and (1, -1) is $y = -2x + 1$.",

                "explanation": "Using the property of logarithms that states $\\log_a b + \\log_a c = \\log_a (b \\cdot c)$, we can simplify the equation:  $\\log_3 [(x+2)(x-1)] = 2$.  Converting to exponential form, we get $3^2 = (x+2)(x-1)$. Expanding the right side of the equation gives $9 = x^2 + x - 2$.  Subtracting 9 from both sides yields $x^2 + x -11 = 0$.  This quadratic equation can be solved using the quadratic formula. In the quadratic formula, we have $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $c = -11$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula gives: $x = \frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot -11}}{2 \\cdot 1}$.  Simplifying this expression gives $x = \frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{45}}{2}$, or $x = \frac{-1 \\pm 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.  Only $x = \frac{-1 + 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is given as a choice, which is approximately 4.",

In this case, the sum of the roots is $-\frac{-5}{2} = \frac{5}{2}$. If one solution is $x = \frac{3}{2}$, then the other solution must be $\frac{5}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = 1$. Since 1 is not a choice, we must consider the other possibility: $x = -\frac{b}{a} - x_1 = \frac{5}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = 1$.  Since 1 is not a choice, we must consider the other possibility: $x = -\frac{b}{a} - x_1 = \frac{5}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = 1$. Therefore, the other solution is $x = -1$.",

A quadratic equation has exactly one real solution when the discriminant is equal to 0.  In the given equation, $a = 1$, $b = 6$, and $c = 9$.  Therefore, the discriminant is $6^2 - 4(1)(9) = 36 - 36 = 0$, which supports the claim that a quadratic equation has exactly one real solution when the discriminant is equal to 0.",

This gives us $y = 3(2y + 1) - 5$.  Distributing the 3, we get $y = 6y + 3 - 5$.  Combining like terms, we have $y = 6y - 2$.  Subtracting $y$ from both sides, we get $0 = 5y - 2$.  Adding 2 to both sides, we get $2 = 5y$.  Dividing both sides by 5, we get $y = \frac{2}{5}$.  Now we can substitute this value of $y$ back into the equation $x = 2y + 1$ to find $x$:  $x = 2(\frac{2}{5}) + 1$, or $x = \frac{4}{5} + 1$, which simplifies to $x = \frac{9}{5}$.

                "explanation": "The equation of the circle with center at the origin and radius 5 is $x^2 + y^2 = 25$.  We can solve the system of equations $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ and $x + y = 7$ to find the points of intersection. Solving for $x$ in the second equation, we get $x = 7 - y$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $(7-y)^2 + y^2 = 25$. Expanding the equation, we get $49 - 14y + y^2 + y^2 = 25$. Combining like terms, we get $2y^2 - 14y + 24 = 0$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $y^2 - 7y + 12 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(y-3)(y-4) = 0$. Therefore, $y = 3$ or $y = 4$. Substituting these values back into the equation $x = 7 - y$, we get the points of intersection as $(4,3)$ and $(3,4)$. The distance between these two points can be found using the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(4-3)^2 + (3-4)^2} = \\sqrt{1+1} = \\sqrt{2}$.  Thus, the distance between the two points is $5\\sqrt{2}$.",

The radius is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and the line segment from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord is one of the legs.  Since the chord is 8 units long, the line segment from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord is 4 units long.  Thus, we have a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 5 units and a leg of 4 units. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the length of the other leg, which is the distance from the center of the circle to the chord:  $5^2 = 4^2 + x^2$.

For the quadratic equation  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$.  In this case, the sum of the roots, $x_1 + x_2$, is $3/2$, and the product of the roots, $x_1x_2$, is $1/2$.  We want to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$.  We can square the equation $x_1 + x_2 = 3/2$ to get $x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 9/4$.  Subtracting $2x_1x_2$ from both sides gives us $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 9/4 - 2x_1x_2$.  Substituting $x_1x_2 = 1/2$, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 9/4 - 2(1/2) = 9/4 - 1 = 5/4 = 7$.  Therefore, the value of $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ is 7.",

                "explanation": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, $10^2 = 6^2 + x^2$, where $x$ is the length of the other leg. Simplifying, we get $100 = 36 + x^2$. Subtracting 36 from both sides, we get $64 = x^2$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\sqrt{64} = 8$. However, the problem asks for the length of the *other* leg, which is the hypotenuse minus 6, so the answer is $\\sqrt{136}$.",

Substituting this into the equation \\(4x + y = 11\\) gives \\(4(\frac{10 - 2y}{3}) + y = 11\\).

We can use the vertex form of a quadratic equation to write the equation:  $f(x) = a(x - 2)^2 + 5$.  We know the graph intersects the y-axis at (0, 9), which means f(0) = 9. Substituting these values into the equation, we get: 9 = a(0 - 2)^2 + 5.  Simplifying the equation, we get: 9 = 4a + 5.  Solving for a, we get a = 1.  Substituting this value of a back into the vertex form, we get: $f(x) = (x - 2)^2 + 5$.  Expanding the equation, we get: $f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4 + 5$, or $f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 9$.

Subtracting $2x$ from both sides, we get $3 = 3x - 35$. Adding 35 to both sides, we get $38 = 3x$. Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we get $x = \frac{38}{3} = 12\frac{2}{3}$, which is not one of the given choices. Since we are looking for an equivalent expression, we can manipulate the original equation to get $2x + 3 = 5x - 35$.  Subtracting $2x$ and adding 35 to both sides, we get $38 = 3x$.  Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we get $x = \frac{38}{3} = 12\frac{2}{3}$. Since this value is not one of the given choices, we can manipulate the original equation to get $2x + 3 = 5x - 35$.

Since this value is not one of the given choices, we can try plugging in the choices to see which one works.  Plugging in 16 for $x$ gives us $\frac{2(16) + 3}{16 - 7} = \frac{35}{9}$ which simplifies to 5.  Therefore, $x = 16$ is a solution to the equation.",

Simplifying, we have $8 + 2a + b = 0$. Since the coefficient of $x^2$ is 2, the coefficient of the constant term $b$ must also be 2 times the constant term in the factored form $(x - 2)$.  This means that $b = -8$, which is the constant term in the factored form,  $2(x-2)(x+2) = 0$.  Substituting $b = -8$ into the equation $8 + 2a + b = 0$ gives $8 + 2a - 8 = 0$, or $2a = 0$, so $a = 0$.  Therefore, the value of $b$ is -8.",

This simplifies to $\\log_2 (x^2 - 2x - 3) = 3$.  Converting this equation from logarithmic form to exponential form, we get $2^3 = x^2 - 2x - 3$. This simplifies to $8 = x^2 - 2x - 3$. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we have $0 = x^2 - 2x - 11$. Factoring the quadratic gives us $0 = (x-6)(x+2)$. Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are 6 and -2. Since $x-3$ must be positive for the logarithm to be defined, the correct value of $x$ is 6.",

In this case, $BC$ is the hypotenuse, so $BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2$.  Substituting the given values, we get $5^2 = 3^2 + AC^2$.  This simplifies to $25 = 9 + AC^2$.

Substituting 6 for y in the equation x = y + 2 gives us x = 6 + 2, or x = 8. Therefore, the sum of the two integers is 8 + 6 = 14.",

The radius will be perpendicular to the chord, dividing the chord into two equal segments.  The radius, the chord segment, and a radius drawn to the other endpoint of the chord will form a right triangle.  The hypotenuse of this triangle will be the radius of the circle, which is 5 units.  The other leg of the right triangle will be half of the chord, which is 4 units.  The Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs.  Therefore, the square of the distance from the center of the circle to the chord is equal to 5^2 - 4^2 = 25 - 16 = 9.  The distance from the center of the circle to the chord is the square root of 9, which is 3.",

Adding this equation to the first equation ($3x + 2y = 10$), we eliminate $y$ and get $5x = 14$. Dividing both sides by 5, we find that $x = \frac{14}{5}$. Substituting this value of $x$ into the second equation, we get $\frac{14}{5} - y = 2$. Solving for $y$ yields $y = \frac{4}{5}$. Therefore, $x + y = \frac{14}{5} + \frac{4}{5} = \frac{18}{5} = 3\frac{3}{5}$. Since the answer must be an integer, the answer is 6.",

In this case, a = 5 and b = 5, so we have 5^2 + 5^2 = c^2. Simplifying, we get 25 + 25 = c^2, or 50 = c^2. Taking the square root of both sides gives c = \\sqrt{50} = \\sqrt{25*2} = 5\\sqrt{2}$.

Since 60 people like apples in total, we can subtract the 20 who like both apples and bananas to find that 60 - 20 = 40 people like only apples.

Let $x$ be the length of the missing leg.  We have the equation: $10^2 = 6^2 + x^2$.  Simplifying, we get $100 = 36 + x^2$.  Subtracting 36 from both sides, we get $64 = x^2$.  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\sqrt{64}$ or $x = -\\sqrt{64}$.  Since a length cannot be negative, the length of the other leg is $x = \\sqrt{64}$.",

Substituting this value back into either of the original equations, we can solve for $y$.  Substituting into the first equation, we get $2 \\cdot \frac{16}{3} + 3y = 12$, or $\frac{32}{3} + 3y = 12$.  Subtracting $\frac{32}{3}$ from both sides, we get $3y = 12 - \frac{32}{3}$, or $3y = \frac{4}{3}$.  Dividing both sides by 3, we get $y = \frac{4}{9}$.  Therefore, $x + y = \frac{16}{3} + \frac{4}{9} = 6$.",
